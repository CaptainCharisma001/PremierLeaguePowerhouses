## 📊Insights 

1. Liverpool were super strong in all areas.

2. Man city irrespective of their dominance in terms of possession weren't clinical up front and conceded a lot of goals.

3. Chelsea were behind in terms of scoring and conceded the most.

4. Arsenal were strong, conceded less amongst all but not so clinical upfront which made them come second on the log.

5. Most players with less minutes would have actually gotten more goal contributions if they had played same minutes with Mohammed Salah. 

6. Mohammed Salah really stood out in all areas despite playing as a winger and not a striker, having the most goals contribution. 

## NOTE: Data used for this Analysis may vary depending on source.
